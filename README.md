# Laplace
Sample Julia code to generate a .gif showing heat dispersion in a single dimension

# Quickstart
1. Install `DifferentialEquations`, `Plots`, and `LinearAlgebra`
2. Open Julia and change to the appropriate directory
3. Run HeatEqn.jl

# Background
Temperature follows a famous partial differential equation called Laplace's Equation. Laplace's equation can be simulated using finite element modelling and linear algebra.

Julia's `DifferentialEquations` suite makes modelling finite elements very easy. This code helps visualize what happens to the temperature within an object as time passes.

This code was produced using open source software for educational purpose. Feel free to use and adapt this code as needed or submit changes.
